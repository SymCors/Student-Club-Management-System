# Student-Club-Management-System
With this Android management project, it is now easier for the head of student clubs to manage their projects as well as lead their members. What can you do with this application?

You can post news regarding the upcoming events to inform all the members. As soon as a new post is shared, every member receives a push notification which lets them get informed as to what they were about to miss. Furthermore, they can like and comment on the posts to discuss or show that they agree. Sharing option will soon be activated.

Every member has also got a profile page where they can see their status, set their profile pictures and see the stats as to how many projects they did, how many times they got liked and so on. They can also see their authorizations inside the student club.

Depending on the authorizations, there are other sections like registers, projects, meet-ups, assignments and finance.

In the Register section, again depending on your authorization given by the head of the club management, you can see the information of all the members as well as those whom are heading. The third and the last tab belongs to the references, who can help the club out with any sort of needs.

In the project tab, there is the information of the projects worked on by the selected members.

Meet-ups section is for all the scheduled meetups including upcoming ones, and the other tab is for the user to see which one they attended to.

Assignments are showing the information of the ones in progress as well as the ones already done. Users can also see their assignments there.

Finance is to manage every cost including their receipts.
